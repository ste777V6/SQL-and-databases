A relational database is a type of database that organizes and stores data in a structured format using tables, which consist of rows and columns. It uses a relational model, where data is represented as relations (mathematical term for tables). Each table, or relation, represents a specific entity (like customers, orders, or products) and is related to other tables through keys.

Key Concepts of a Relational Database
 
1 - Tables:
The primary structure for storing data.
Each table is made up of:
Rows (Records): Represent individual data entries.
Columns (Attributes): Represent data fields or properties.

Example of a table:
Customer_ID	Name	Email	            Age
1	Alice Smith	  alice@example.com	  25
2	Bob Johnson	  bob@example.com	    30

2 - Primary Key:
A unique identifier for each row in a table.
Ensures that no two rows in a table are identical.
Example: In the table above, Customer_ID is the primary key.

3 - Foreign Key:
A field in one table that links to the primary key in another table.
Used to establish a relationship between two tables.
Example: An Orders table may have a Customer_ID column that acts as a foreign key linking it to the Customer table.

4 - Relationships:
Data in different tables is connected using keys. Common types of relationships are:
One-to-One: Each record in one table relates to one record in another table.
One-to-Many: A record in one table relates to multiple records in another.
Many-to-Many: Records in one table relate to multiple records in another, typically using a junction table.

5 - SQL (Structured Query Language):
The standard language used to interact with relational databases.
Allows for creating tables, inserting data, querying, updating, and deleting data.
Example query:

SELECT Name, Email
FROM Customers
WHERE Age > 25;
